By default, Quaremain uses SBCL compiler to build a small sized self\-contained executable with the trade off of high\-memory usage\.
.
.P
If you prefer lower memory usage, use CCL (Clozure implementation) to build, but with the result of bigger executable\.
.
.P
Deployment tarball size shouldn\'t really matter, if you distribute it as a compressed archive\.
.
.P
By default, uses SBCL to compile\.
.
.P
Replace with make LISP=lx86cl64 to use CCL\.
.

.SH "Distributing For End Users"
Currently, Quaremain is tested on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and Ubuntu 20\.04 (Focal Fossa)\. You must build on similar target platform to make a working distributable self\-contained executable tarball archive\.
.
.P
In a nutshell, if you want to distribute a run\-out\-of\-the box Quaremain software for Ubuntu 20\.04, you must build Quaremain on Ubuntu 20\.04\. Same for OpenSUSE Tumbleweed\.
.
.P
To simplify this process, run:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB$ make ubuntu20\.04\-tarball\fR if you want to build for Ubuntu 20\.04

.SH "Known Issues"
.
.IP "1." 4
Server build with Clozure Common Lisp implementation [Version 1\.11\.5/v1\.11\.5 (LinuxX8664)] quitting phase ends up in the debugger instead of actually exiting program\.
.
.IP "2." 4
Smaller client window (if resized) will likely hide the navigation toolbars\. Maybe set a minimal default size to fix this issue?
.
.IP "3." 4
You always need to (slime\-cd) in SLIME to the project directory\. This should be resolved soon since it seems Deploy handles the relative path for the end executable automatically\. We can go back to use merge\-pathnames and current project directory if my assumption about Deploy is correct\.
.
.IP "4." 4
Memory usage of SBCL\'s built executable is unnecesarily high\. I tried it with CCL and it uses around 20\-30MB+ compared to SBCL\'s 100MB+ for the same version of the program\. It seems this issue caused by the SBCL garbage collector type usage (sacrificing memory for the excellent execution speed, I believe?)\.

.P
Will certainly make CCL as the default implementation but it\'s not possible currently due to issue 1\.
